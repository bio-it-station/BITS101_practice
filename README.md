Example:

## Cheng-Hung-Tsai.md

I received my M.S. degree in Biochemical Science and Technology from National Taiwan University in 2015. I was focusing on the structure and regulation of starch phosphorylase from sweet potatos in my previous research. I joined the lab as a research assistant in June of 2017 and found that it was totally different between wet-lab and dry-lab. In the past, I used to do protein purification, electrophoresis and western blot, but I’m knocking on the keyboard now! In my leisure time, I enjoy playing basketball and swimming. Sometimes I went to play dart with my friend in the weekend.

## Yu-Ting-Liu.md

I graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University.  Since 2017, I’ve jumped into projects in Computer Vision of Deep Learning.  I improved the performance of video captioning tasks by developing a new structure of Long-Short Term Memory model and have been developing a video-content-based searching engine by converting videos into text summaries.  This year, I’m very lucky to join BITS lab for lots of interesting programs, such as termite recognition and application developing programs.  Hope I can gain knowledge about bioinformatics, improve problem-solving skills, and most importantly, get these meaningful programs off the ground to help lots of people.
