I graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University.  Since 2017, I’ve jumped into projects in Computer Vision of Deep Learning.  Iimproved the performance of video captioning tasks by developing a new structure of Long-Short Term Memory model and have been developing a video-content-based searching engine by converting videos into text summaries.  This year, I’m very lucky to join BITS lab for lots of interesting programs, such as termite recognition and application developing programs.  Hope I can gain knowledge about bioinformatics, improve problem-solving skills, and most importantly, get these meaningful programs off the ground to help lots of people
